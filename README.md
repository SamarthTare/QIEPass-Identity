# QIEPass: Soulbound Identity System 🛡️

**Built for QIE Blockchain Hackathon 2025**

## 💡 The Problem
In the digital age, certificates and identities are easily forged or sold. Traditional NFTs can be transferred, making them unsuitable for proving personal achievements (like a degree or a hackathon win).

## 🚀 The Solution: QIEPass
QIEPass implements **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** on the QIE Layer-1 Blockchain.
- **Non-Transferable:** Once minted, the identity badge cannot be sent to another wallet.
- **Verifiable:** Employers or institutions can verify credentials on-chain instantly.
- **Cost-Effective:** Leverages QIE's low gas fees for mass adoption.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** QIE Network (EVM Compatible)
- **Smart Contract:** Solidity (ERC-721 Modified)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), Ethers.js
- **Tools:** Remix IDE, MetaMask
